Implementation of a physics engine 
Currently the engine can simulate 2D and 3D physics for point masses alongwith collision detection and resolution.

Dependencies:
1.) OpenGL GLUT.
2.) C++ (GNU compiler preferable)

1) navigate to one of the folders (Except headers) in the command line
2) Execute g++ *.cpp -lGL -lglut -lGLU

For Windows users, there may be issues with OpenGL GLUT installation and usage. 

Future Work:
Adding Rigid Body Mechanics in 2D and 3D, possibly fluid dynamics as well
Optimization in equation calculations for better performance
